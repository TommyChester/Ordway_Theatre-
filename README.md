Assumptions of assignment:
1. That the json blob will never show missing available seats. 
2. Though it is probably unrealistic, for this particular exercise I am going to assume that venues are rectangular and every row has the same number column intersections and every column has the same number for row interactions.

Jan 21. Okay so I went to start this the other day, well... After nokogiri wouldnt load which lead to me realizing that brew and rvm were not working, which lead to me realizing that all my root core Ruby files were all messed up. All attempts to fix this were futile (I even managed to mess the JSON gem which lead to not being to download anything correctly), I decided it was best to reinstall macOS. 

First things first was to get VScode, rails, brew, git, some other things I already forgot running. But at this point I think my ops problems are over until I try to host it on heroku. 


Jan 22. Well I learned last night that I am going on ski trip. Had to get my ski stuff together and I am hoping to get some time today to work on this as I am not going to be able to work on it over the weekend.
